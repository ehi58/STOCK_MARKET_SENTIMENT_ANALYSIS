# STOCK_MARKET_SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS
In the year 2020, the stock market has seen some high volatility due to COV-19. I applied sentiment analysis to a portfolio of stocks.I have chosen to analyze earnings call transcripts. An earnings call is a conference call between the management of a public company. An earnings call discusses the company's financial results during a given reporting period. I examined how the stock price was flowing at opening date of each earnings call event.

### WORD COUNT
Each earnings call has certain amount of words. This could be a important factor in determining sentiment. Length of words on a call might be a measure of how much news there was on stock; therefore, it shows how much impact of a stock price.In assumption, big news tend to have more need of a conversation in why something occurred.

### SENTIMENT
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Emotions are determined with polarity. Polarity takes into account the amount of positive or negative terms that appear in a given sentence.
